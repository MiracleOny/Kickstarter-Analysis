# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use pivot tables and graphing in Excel to vizualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Over all, theater is a popular and successful campaign category. Out of 1369 theater campaigns, 61% were successful, 36% failed and 3% were canceled. May experienced the most successful campaigns, while December was the least succesful. From April to May we see a spike in successful campaigns that tapers off at the end of the year. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As campagin goals increase, success decrease and failures increase. However, this trend is obscured by a spike between goals ranging from 35000 and 44999.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were a few challenges and limitations in this analysis. It's not clear why there aren't any records of canceled campaigns in the month of October and why there's a spike in failed campaigns following a slightly lower number of failed campaigns. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn are (1) May is the best month to launch a campaign and (2) campaigns started in December have a high likelihood of failing. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What we can conclude about Outcomes based on Goals is that campaigns have a greater chance of succeeding when they are less than $5000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations to this dataset stem from a poor sample size, not enough variables included in the analysis such as backers_count, deadlines, and country of campaign. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create graphs that include outcomes based on launch date and deadlines and outcomes based on goals and launch date. Another possible graph could be goals, pledges, and backers_count. Lastly, we could create a graph that looked at outcomes based on country of campaign.
