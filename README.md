# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use pivot tables and graphing in Excel to vizualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Over all, theater is a popular and successful campaign category. Out of 4064 Campaigns only 
spike of successful campiagns that bgan in june, but that tapers off by the end of the year.
trend lines are a bit all over the place and less predictable

Every May there is a spike in the number of successful campigns 
Decline in campignes after spike in may
minuture spikes around february and october
Great decline in December such that it surpases number of failed campigneds  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


 Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
