# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use pivot tables and graphing in Excel to vizualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Over all, theater is a popular and successful campaign category. Out of 1369 theater campaigns, 61% were successful, 36% failed and 3% were canceled. May experienced the most successful campaigns, while December was the least succesful. From April to May we see a spike in successful campaigns that tapers off at the end of the year. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Trend lines are all over the place and less predictable.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were a few challenges and limitations in this analysis. It's not clear why there aren't any records of canceled campaigns in the month of October and why there's a spike in failed campaigns following a slightly lower number of failed campaigns. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn are (1) May is the best month to launch a campaign and (2) campaigns started in December have a high likelihood of failing.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a bar graph of clusetered column or bar graph crpssed with a line graph displaying percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on goals. Results would include the months within each month

Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
The analysis was performed using a pivot table in excel. the table was filtered based on "Parent Category" and "Years".


by October had the highest amount of failures meanwhile 
spike of successful campiagns that bgan in june, but that tapers off by the end of the year.
trend lines are a bit all over the place and less predictable
June seems to be a good month to launch a campaign02

Oct 2010 is the first launch date that successfully completed campaigns. 
2010 - 2017 Play campaigns
Every May there is a spike in the number of successful campigns 
Decline in campignes after spike in may
minuture spikes around february and october
Great decline in December such that it surpases number of failed campigneds
